Provenance
----------

This validator is based on the Shape Expressions being developed by Eric Prud'hommeaux. 

You can find a primer for Shape Expressions at http://www.w3.org/2013/ShEx/Primer.html

You can find a simple demonstrator page for Shape Expressions http://www.w3.org/2013/ShEx/SimpleShExDemo

There is a fancier demonstration page at http://www.w3.org/2013/ShEx/FancyShExDemo

All of Eric's examples are in the directory http://www.w3.org/2013/ShEx/

--

Initially the idea is to create a shape file for each of the different levels of dataset description and then to have these at the different strictness criteria, viz MUST, SHOULD, MAY. These together with examples will be made available here.

Eventually a fancy frontend will be created to allow the uploading of descriptions and testing against different strictnesses of validation.
